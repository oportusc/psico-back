    time
    type
    reason
    psychologist {
      firstName
      lastName
      specialty
      email
    }
  }
}
```

### **Test 4: Update Appointment (Transfer Between Psychologists)**

```graphql
mutation {
  updateAppointment(
    id: "APPOINTMENT_ID_HERE"
    updateAppointmentInput: {
      psychologistId: "NEW_PSYCHOLOGIST_ID_HERE"
      reason: "Transferred to specialist"
    }
  ) {

    time
    type
    reason
